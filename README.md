#### Jobify - Description
You work in developing a big industry. In this industry they do not have to update the company's main website very often, however, it is a major complaint from the human resources area that it takes too long to post new job openings on the site - as this also delays new hires and is directly impacting the company's growth. The company's website is all static and updates always take time to perform (they go through a bureaucratic process, and take up to 15 days to happen). Your boss wants a way to help the human resources team by streamlining this process without having to redo the entire site and without having to create an extensive system (with authentication and lots of rules) - because your team has many other demands. He wants to expedite this process even if it involves someone on his team (perhaps an intern) to “copy and paste” the new vacancies so that the site can be updated more quickly. Applicants apply for the job by sending a specific email that the human resources personnel checks daily. Your boss wants updates to happen safely and quickly, and has given you 2 days to complete the project.
